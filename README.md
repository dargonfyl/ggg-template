# GGG Template
glad, glm, and glfw all in one. Inspired by [bigg](https://github.com/JoshuaBrookover/bigg).

## Requirements
You will need:
- OpenGL version 3.3+ capable system
- CMake installed

## Building
Run the following:
```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. [-G your-target-generator]
$ cmake --build .
```
__NOTE:__ You should configure with 64-bit. To quote the Linux manuals, _undefined behaviour_ may occur if you do not.
